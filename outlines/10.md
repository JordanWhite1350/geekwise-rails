# Day 10: Exercises

We'll begin developing on the [Day 10](https://github.com/djreimer/flutter/tree/day-10) branch of [Flutter](https://github.com/djreimer/flutter). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/djreimer/flutter.git
    $ cd flutter
    $ git checkout day-10

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd flutter
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-10

## Follow Button

**Exercise:** Implement and test the follow button.

## Follower Ratio

**Exercise:** Write a method that determines a user's follower-to-following ratio. For example, if I follow 100 users and 300 users follow me, then my ratio is 3. Please include tests and be mindful of edge cases.

**Discuss:** Introduce the concept of mocking and stubbing.
