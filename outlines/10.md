# Day 10: Exercises

We'll begin developing on the [Day 10](https://github.com/djreimer/flutter/tree/day-10) branch of [Flutter](https://github.com/djreimer/flutter). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/djreimer/flutter.git
    $ cd flutter
    $ git checkout day-10

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd flutter
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-10

## Follow Button

**Exercise:** Implement and test the follow button.

## Follower Ratio

**Exercise:** Write a method that determines a user's follower-to-following ratio. For example, if I follow 100 users and 300 users follow me, then my ratio is 3. Please include tests and be mindful of edge cases.

**Discuss:** Introduce the concept of mocking and stubbing.

## Reply Detection

**Exercise:** Your task is to detect when a status is a reply. Replies are unique in that they *begin* with an @username. For example, the following status is a reply:

<blockquote>@derrickreimer how do we do this task?</blockquote>

If a status is deemed to be a reply, then store a reference to the user being replied to on the status record. (Hint: You will need to perform a database migration). This detection process should automatically happen right before the status record is created.

Once complete, I should be able to call `status.reply_user` and get back the correct `User` instance is the status is a reply.

As always, please include tests.

## Mention Detection

**Exercise:** This is similar to the previous exercise, only this time you need to detect ALL mentions that occur in a status. You will need to *store a reference* to each mentioned user in the database. Keep in mind there can be **more than one** mention in any given status.

## Hyperlink Mentions to Profiles

**Exercise:** Automatically hyperlink each @-mention to the mentioner's profile page.

## Mentions Page

**Exercise:** Add a "mentions" page that lists all statuses that mention the currently logged in user.
