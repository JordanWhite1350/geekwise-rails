## Overview of Tools

### An Important Distinction

- **Ruby** is the **programmming language** upon which **Rails** is built
- Rails applications are simply Ruby programs that include the `rails` library and utilize its APIs

### Ruby

- A general-purpose scripting language started in the early 1990s
- Designed with "programmer happiness" in mind (principle of least surprise)
- Simple yet very powerful syntax. Can you guess what `3.times { puts "Hello World" }` does?
- Dynamically-typed, interpreted (not compiled)
- Object-oriented (everything is an object, even primitives like `String` and `Integer`)
- Easy to extend the language though monkey-patching (a double edged sword)
- Powerful metaprogramming capabilities. Translated: this allows Rails to have some really nice and "magical" APIs
- Resources to check out:
    - Books
        - [Programming Ruby](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) (the pickaxe)
        - [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)
    - Interactive
        - [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
        - [Code School's Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/)
    - Websites
        - [Official Ruby Language Site](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
        - [Ruby Doc](http://ruby-doc.org/) (standard library documentation)
        - [Ruby Glossary](http://www.codecademy.com/glossary/ruby)

#### A Note about Ruby Implementations

There are a multitude of Ruby implementions. The most prominent implementations include:

- **MRI** (Matz' Ruby Interpreter) a.k.a. **C Ruby** a.k.a **YARV**
    - The reference implementation run by the language creator, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
- **[JRuby](http://jruby.org/)** - Ruby implementation on the JVM
    - Advantages
        - Can interoperate with Java libraries
        - Has native threading
    - Disadvantages
        - Does not work with Ruby code that relies on C extensions
        - Uses the JVM
- **[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/)**
    - Ruby written in Ruby

We will be using recent versions of MRI (=> 1.9.x) in this class.

### Rails

- A web application framework optimized for rapid development and maintainability
- Started by David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals as an extraction from Basecamp (project management web app)
- Follows the MVC pattern (model / view / controller) - a nice separation of concerns
    - **Models**: the place for domain logic and persistance
    - **Views**: the layer where responses are rendered (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.)
    - **Controllers**: the glue layer between models and views
- Convention over configuration. Some examples:
    - If you have a model called `User` in your app, Rails assumes there's a table called `users`
      in the database
    - If you have a column in the `users` table called `email`, then `user.email` just works
    - If you have a resource called `users` defined in your routes file, then Rails automatically
      sends requests to the `UsersController`
- REST
    - Based on an academic dissertation about how to architect distributed systems (like HTTP)
    - More info on the guts of REST [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer),
      for the curious ones
    - Rails has been accused by purists of butchering the definition of REST
    - Mostly just applies to way URLs are mapped to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions
    - More info to follow
- DRY (don't repeat yourself)
    - A basic principle of software development
    - DRYness comes up ALOT in the Rails community
    - If you find yourself duplicating logic (or just copy-pasting code), you're *probably* doing it wrong
- TDD (test-driven development)
    - Automated unit testing is a must
    - Some adhere to string TDD - write a test, watch it fail, write code to make it pass, then clean up your code. 
      Also known as "red, green, refactor"
    - I rarely actually write tests first - to each their own
    - Testing could be a class all on its own
    - Several popular frameworks: [Minitest (included in Ruby standard lib)](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) 
    - Most important things is that you just write tests!
    - We'll be using Minitest + several other tools (more info to follow)

### Rubygems

- The package manager for Ruby
- Community hosted at [http://rubygems.org/](http://rubygems.org/)
- Rails itself is a gem
- Some gems are Rails extentions, others are just plain old Ruby
- Every Ruby installation comes with the `gem` command
- Installing a gem: `gem install [gem name]`

### Text Editor

- Any editor will do
- I prefer [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) these days
- Commonly used editors
    - [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
    - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
    - Vim & Emacs (not my flavor - to each their own)

### Version Control (Git)

- We will be using Git + GitHub exclusively for version control in this course
- You don't have to be a git expert right off the bat
- Learn commands as you go, eventually you will "commit" them to memory (pun intended)
- Resources:
    - [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) (free online book)
    - [Code School + GitHub's Try Git](http://try.github.io/) (interactive tutorial)
- Have we all heard of [GitHub](https://github.com)?

## Setting up your Ruby Environment

- There are several tools available for *-nix
    - [RVM](http://rvm.io/)

- Make sure everyone is setup

## Getting Acquainted with Ruby

Open up your Terminal and fire up `irb`:

    irb

### Hello World

The `puts` method outputs to the console.

    > puts "Hello World"

### Variable Assignment

No type declarations needed.

    > number = 5

### Everything is an Object

Statically-typed languages often treat built-in types (strings, ints, booleans, etc.) different than other objects. In Ruby, there is no distinction.

    > number.class
    > "Hello".class
    > "Hello".reverse
    > "Hello".upcase

### Symbols

A `Symbol` is similar to a string. Symbols are used **everywhere**.

    > my_symbol = :foo

### Hashes

A `Hash` is a key-value "dictionary" object. Any object can be a key, but generally it's a `String`, `Symbol`, or `Integer`.

    > my_hash = Hash.new
    > my_hash = {}
    > my_hash["foo"] = "bar"
    > my_hash[:name] = "Bob"
    > new_hash = { :name => "Bob" }

### Arrays

    > my_array = Array.new
    > my_array = []
    > my_array << "an_item"
    > my_array.push("another_item")
    > my_array.pop
    > my_array.count
    > my_array.include?("an_item")

### Nil

`nil` represents "null" in Ruby. 

    > nothing = nil
    > nothing.class

### String Interpolation

    > first_name = "John"
    > last_name = "Doe"
    > full_name = "#{first_name} #{last_name}"

### Control Flow

    > x = 1
    > y = 2
    > x == y
    > x < y
    > x != y

`if` statements look at whether the conditional is "truthy" or "falsey". The values `false` and `nil` are falsey; everything else is truthy.

### Blocks and Iterators

Suppose you want to print every element in an array. You could use a while loop to do this:

    > my_array = [1, 2, 3]
    > i = 0
    > while i < my_array.length do
    >   puts my_array[i]
    >   i = i + 1
    > end

But, `while` (and `for`) loops are not often used in Ruby. Instead, we generally use iterators.

    > my_array = [1, 2, 3]
    > my_array.each { |item| puts item }

    > my_array.each do |item|
    >   puts item
    > end

In the above example, `each` is a method that takes a block and calls it for every element in the collection. A block is like a regular method (only it has no name). The block is passed the element in the `item` argument each time it is called.

    > 3.times { puts "Hi!" }
    > (0..4).each { |num| puts num }

## Creating your first Rails app

Let's begin our Twitter clone, Flutter.

    $ cd your/code/directory
    $ rails new flutter
    $ cd flutter

This command generate a whole directory tree for you. Here's an explanation of each folder, courtesy of [Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book#sec-the_first_application).

Before getting started, let's make our initial commit to version control:

    $ git init .
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit"

## Managing External Dependencies

All the external gem dependencies for a Rails application are stored in the Gemfile. The Gemfile is used by [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). Let's take a look at Rails' default dependencies.

Anytime you update the Gemfile, you need to run `bundle install`.

## The Router

The Rails router is responsible for taking incoming web requests and mapping them to the proper **controller**.
The routes file is located under `config/routes.rb`.

A handy way to inspect what routes are defined is by running `rake routes`.

Let's define our first resource for `statuses`

    resources :statuses

The resources method is shorthand for the seven RESTful actions:

    GET        /statuses
    GET        /statuses/new
    POST       /statuses
    GET        /statuses/:id
    GET        /statuses/:id/edit
    PUT/PATCH  /statuses/:id
    DELETE     /statuses/:id

Fire up the local server with `rails server` (or `rails s` for short) and hit [http://localhost:3000/statuses](http://localhost:3000/statuses). What do you see?

Learn more: [Rails Routing from the Outside In](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html)

## The Controller Layer

Controllers are the "C" in "MVC". Thanks to convention-over-configuration, Rails knows to look for the `StatusesController` when you hit one of the `statuses` resource. Note: you can change this behavior with -- you guessed it, configuration -- but you're better off following the conventions when possible.

Head over to the `app/controllers` directory. The `ApplicationController` class serves as a base class for other controllers.

Let's create a `StatusesController` to handle requests for statuses. Refresh the page and see what happens now.

Learn more: [Action Controller Overview](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_controller_overview.html)

## The View Layer

Views are the "V" in "MVC". When you hit the index action, Rails knows to look for an HTML template with the name `index`.

Head over to the `app/views` directory, create a `statuses/index.html.erb` file. Refresh the page and see what happens now.

Learn more: [Action View Overview](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_view_overview.html)

## The Model Layer

Models are the "M" in "MVC". They are what we use to create, read, update, and delete data in our application. Rails ships with an object-relational mapper called Active Record. This library allows you perform complex database operations without writing SQL queries (the language that databases speak). Instead, you can express them in Ruby.

Resources:

- [Active Record Basics](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html) + additional guides on models
- [Active record pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)

Let's create our first model. Head over to the `app/models` directory and create a `status.rb` file:

    class Status < ActiveRecord::Base
    end

## Using the Rails Console

Remember IRB from earlier? Rails offers a console, which is essentially IRB with all your application code locked and loaded.

    $ bin/rails console

Or, for short:

    $ bin/rails c

Then try to instantiate a new instance of `Status`. What do you see?

Rails is magical, but not THAT magical - we still have to create our table in the database. Fortunately, Rails has a built-in system for managing and performing database changes.

## Database Migrations

In the previous example we created the `status.rb` file by hand. Rails comes with a generator that will create that file for you AND create the database migration file needed to create our table. Let's delete the file we just created and let the generator do the work for us.

    $ rm app/models/status.rb
    $ bin/rails generate model Status text:text

Let's look at the new file generated in the `db/migrate` directory:

```ruby
class CreateStatuses < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :statuses do |t|
      t.text :text

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Observations:

- A `class` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration`. So, Rails knows that this is a database migration.
- A method called `change` -- Rails will execute this method when you tell it to run the migration.
- Inside `change`, there is a method call to `create_table` with the symbol `:statuses` and a block.
- Inside the block:
    - `t.text :text` will create a `TEXT` column called `text`.
    - `t.timestamps` will create the default timestamp columns: `created_at` and `updated_at`.
- You're probably wondering: where's the primary key?
    - Active Record automatically creates an auto-incrementing integer `id` column

This is an example of a Rails DSL (domain-specific language). We aren't privy to what is actually going on internally, and that's okay. The `create_table` method is an example of the Builder pattern.

There are other similar methods for database modifications -- we will get to those in due time.

Now that our migration is ready to go, we need to run it.

    $ bin/rake db:migrate
