# Day 1: Introduction

## Who are we?

### About Me

- I've been developing for the web for ~5 years
- Got heavy into Ruby on Rails development ~3 years ago
- Now I'm working on [Drip](https://www.getdrip.com/) and we need some help
- Email: derrickreimer at gmail dot com
- Twitter: [@derrickreimer](https://twitter.com/derrickreimer) 

### Student Intros

- What's your career background?
- Do you have experience with...
    - HTML/CSS?
    - JavaScript?
    - Server-side development (PHP/Ruby/Python/Perl/.NET etc.)?
    - Ruby?
- What do you hope to gain from this class?

## Overview of Tools

### An Important Distinction

- **Ruby** is the **programmming language** upon which **Rails** is built
- Rails applications are simply Ruby programs that include the `rails` library and utilize its APIs

### Ruby

- A general-purpose scripting language started in the early 1990s
- Designed with "programmer happiness" in mind (principle of least surprise)
- Simple yet very powerful syntax. Can you guess what `3.times { puts "Hello World" }` does?
- Dynamically-typed, interpreted (not compiled)
- Object-oriented (everything is an object, even primitives like `String` and `Integer`)
- Easy to extend the language though monkey-patching (a double edged sword)
- Powerful metaprogramming capabilities. Translated: this allows Rails to have some really nice and "magical" APIs
- Resources to check out:
    - Books
        - [Programming Ruby](http://ruby-doc.com/docs/ProgrammingRuby/) (the pickaxe)
        - [Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/)
    - Interactive
        - [Codecademy](http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/ruby)
        - [Code School's Try Ruby](http://tryruby.org/)
    - Websites
        - [Official Ruby Language Site](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
        - [Ruby Doc](http://ruby-doc.org/) (standard library documentation)

#### A Note about Ruby Implementations

There are a multitude of Ruby implementions. The most prominent implementations include:

- **MRI** (Matz' Ruby Interpreter) a.k.a. **C Ruby** a.k.a **YARV**
    - The reference implementation run by the language creator, Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto
- **[JRuby](http://jruby.org/)** - Ruby implementation on the JVM
    - Advantages
        - Can interoperate with Java libraries
        - Has native threading
    - Disadvantages
        - Does not work with Ruby code that relies on C extensions
        - Uses the JVM
- **[Rubinius](http://rubini.us/)**
    - Ruby written in Ruby

We will be using recent versions of MRI (=> 1.9.x) in this class.

### Rails

- A web application framework optimized for rapid development and maintainability
- Started by David Heinemeier Hansson of 37signals as an extraction from Basecamp (project management web app)
- Follows the MVC pattern (model / view / controller) - a nice separation of concerns
    - **Models**: the place for domain logic and persistance
    - **Views**: the layer where responses are rendered (HTML, JSON, XML, etc.)
    - **Controllers**: the glue layer between models and views
- Convention over configuration. Some examples:
    - If you have a model called `User` in your app, Rails assumes there's a table called `users`
      in the database
    - If you have a column in the `users` table called `email`, then `user.email` just works
    - If you have a resource called `users` defined in your routes file, then Rails automatically
      sends requests to the `UsersController`
- REST
    - Based on an academic dissertation about how to architect distributed systems (like HTTP)
    - More info on the guts of REST [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer),
      for the curious ones
    - Rails has been accused by purists of butchering the definition of REST
    - Mostly just applies to way URLs are mapped to CRUD (create, read, update, delete) actions
    - More info to follow
- DRY (don't repeat yourself)
    - A basic principle of software development
    - DRYness comes up ALOT in the Rails community
    - If you find yourself duplicating logic (or just copy-pasting code), you're *probably* doing it wrong
- TDD (test-driven development)
    - Automated unit testing is a must
    - Some adhere to string TDD - write a test, watch it fail, write code to make it pass, then clean up your code. 
      Also known as "red, green, refactor"
    - I rarely actually write tests first - to each their own
    - Testing could be a class all on its own
    - Several popular frameworks: [Minitest (included in Ruby standard lib)](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) and [RSpec](http://rspec.info/) 
    - Most important things is that you just write tests!
    - We'll be using Minitest + several other tools (more info to follow)

### Rubygems

- The package manager for Ruby
- Community hosted at [http://rubygems.org/](http://rubygems.org/)
- Rails itself is a gem
- Some gems are Rails extentions, others are just plain old Ruby
- Every Ruby installation comes with the `gem` command
- Installing a gem: `gem install [gem name]`

### Text Editor

- Any editor will do
- I prefer [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/) these days
- Commonly used editors
    - [TextMate](http://macromates.com/)
    - [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/)
    - Vim & Emacs (not my flavor - to each their own)

### Version Control (Git)

- We will be using Git + GitHub exclusively for version control in this course
- You don't have to be a git expert right off the bat
- Learn commands as you go, eventually you will "commit" them to memory (pun intended)
- Resources:
    - [Pro Git](http://git-scm.com/book) (free online book)
    - [Code School + GitHub's Try Git](http://try.github.io/) (interactive tutorial)
- Have we all heard of [GitHub](https://github.com)?
