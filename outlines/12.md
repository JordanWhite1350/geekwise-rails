# Day 12: More Exercises

We'll begin developing on the [Day 12](https://github.com/djreimer/flutter/tree/day-12) branch of [Flutter](https://github.com/djreimer/flutter). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/djreimer/flutter.git
    $ cd flutter
    $ git checkout day-12

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd flutter
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-12
