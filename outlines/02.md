# Day 2: User Registration & Authentication

## Creating Users

Up to this point, our data model has consisted of only one database table containing statuses. We need to create a table to store user data.

**Exercise:** Generate a `User` model with the following string attributes: `email`, `screen_name`, `full_name`, `url`, `password_hash`, `password_salt`. [This guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-generate) on using the `rails generate` command may come in handy.

## Validations

**Discuss:** What validation rules need to be in place?

Before writing validations, let's make sure our user fabricator is in a valid state.

We need to use sequences in our fabricator to prevent uniqueness issues. [Explore the docs](http://www.fabricationgem.org/#!sequences) to learn how.

**Exercise:** Implement validation rules with tests. This may help: [Active Record Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html).
