# Day 2: Beginning the User Interface

## Passing Data To The View Layer

Now that we've manually created some statuses, let's display them in the user interface.

First, we'll write some tests around our `StatusesController#index` action:

```ruby
require 'test_helper'

class StatusesControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  context "GET #index" do
    setup { get :index }

    should respond_with(200)
    should render_template("index")
    should "assign to statuses" do
      assert_not_nil assigns(:statuses)
    end
  end
end
```

We want to fetch our statuses and put them in a variable to be passed along to our template. The way to expose data to the view layer is through **instance variables** at the controller layer:

```ruby
class StatusesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @statuses = "All the statuses!"
  end
end
```

Now, in our index view we have access to the `@statuses` variable:

```html
<%= @statuses %>
```

Are your tests passing now? 

Fire up your server and hit [http://localhost:3000/statuses](http://localhost:3000/statuses). What do you see?

## Rendering Dynamic Output with ERB

In our previous example, we rendered the contents of the `@statuses` variable using `<%=  %>`. This tag outputs the return value of whatever Ruby code you put in it. The `<%  %>` tag (no equals sign) also evaluates Ruby code, but does not output the return value.

What we really want to pass in the `@statuses` variable is a collection of all statuses: 

```ruby
class StatusesController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @statuses = Status.all
  end
end
```

In the view, we need to iterate over each status and display it.

```html
<ol class="statuses">
  <% @statuses.each do |status| %>
    <li>
      <p><%= status.text %></p>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ol>
```

Refresh the index view. What do you see?

**Exercise:** Display the date/time at which the status was created underneath the text. [Check out the Ruby Time class docs](http://www.ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Time.html#method-i-strftime) for formatting help.

## Sorting Statuses

We need to explictly sort by creation time in reverse order to make sure the newest statuses appear at the top.

```ruby
@statuses = Status.all.order("created_at DESC")
```
