# Final Project

Choose a project from one of the following(or choose your own, but get it approved first, as it needs to meet the
minimum requirements outlined below)

- Build a simple clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).
- Build a simple blog
- Build a simple [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com) clone.


This project is designed to showcase your Ruby on Rails prowess, so have fun and be creative. I've divided the spec
into two sections: minimum requirements and other ideas for spicing up your app. Feel free to implement other cool
features not included in this spec.

## Minimum Requirements

### Features

- User registration and authentication
- At least one model with a has_many relationship
- At least one model with a belongs_to relationship
- Validations on models
- Integrate some sort of [pagination](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate) in your views
- Well-formed HTML (ERB) views with basic CSS styling (hand-coded please)

### Other Requirements

- Aim for high test coverage
- Use Git + GitHub for version control
- A summary of all the features you've implemented in your README.md file

## Extras

These are just a few things you can do to stretch the limits of your Rails knowledge.

- [Polymorphic](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#polymorphic-associations) relationships.
- [Custom validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html#custom-methods).
- Introduce [service objects](https://netguru.co/blog/service-objects-in-rails-will-help) to handle complex controller logic.
