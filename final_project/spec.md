# Final Project: Geekwise News

Your task is build a simple clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) called Geekwise News. This project is designed to showcase your Ruby on Rails prowess, so have fun and be creative. I've divided the spec into two sections: minimum requirements and other ideas for spicing up your app. Feel free to implement other cool features not included in this spec. 

## Minimum Requirements

### Features

- User registration and authentication
- Ability to submit articles (webpages)
- Ability to comment on articles (nested comments are optional)
- Ability to upvote and downvote articles and comments
- A paginated view of posts (with some logical ordering)
- Well-formed HTML (ERB) views with basic CSS styling (hand-coded please, no CSS frameworks)
    - Note: Don't worry if you aren't a rockstar designer. After all, [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) is no work of art :).

### Other Requirements

- Aim for high test coverage
- Use Git + GitHub for version control
- A summary of all the features you've implemented in your README.md file

## Extras

These are just a few feature ideas to make your project more interesting. If you implement any of these (or any cool feature not in this list), be sure to mention it in your README project summary.

- Implement a "karma score" algorithm
    - On Hacker News, users accumlate karma when other users upvote their submissions & comments
    - There is no right answer -- your algorithm can work however you'd like!
- Implement a ranking algorithm
    - Can be based on how recent it was posted, how many upvotes it has, the karma scores of the upvoters, etc.
    - Again, no right answer on this one
- Automatically populate the title field when users paste in a URL
- Parse out the domain name from the URL to display next to the post title
- Implement a "new" page that lists the newest posts
- Implement nested commenting on articles
- Add social buttons to posts
    - Tweet, Like, Pin, G+, etc.
- Add category tags to posts
